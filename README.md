# Project Development Notes

### Setup directory, Github repo, and hosting `trips.json` for mock API request
The data this application is build around, uses a provided [trips.json](https://storage.googleapis.com/bobs_lab_bucket/json_host/trips.json) file. However, I wanted to serve the `trips.json` resource externally, just to mock out an API request flow for the application.

I used a Google Cloud Storage Bucket to host and serve the file, and on the client-side, I used used the [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) to retrieve the data and convert it into a usable javaScript object.

### Setup directory, Github repo, and hosting `trips.json` for mock API request
When setting up the foundation for this app. I wanted to make sure I had a reference to quickly change any base variables that may need to be changed at a later point. For CSS I created `css/vars.css` to be the "source of truth" for site-wide colors, spaces, sizes, fonts and other vars to maintain.

For javascript I created the file `js/app.js` to be the root trigger for any client-side events, handling initial **onload** events in addition to other ui events and routing if necessary.  

### Resize Images
With a helpful from the Code Challenge directions, I was able to tinker with the image url and discover that adding `width`, `height` and specifying my desiered size of image, allowed me to scale my images smaller for the frontend to load quickly!
- Here is the completed query parameter that was appended: `?height=200&width=356`.

Note: While I was messing around with the scaling endpoint. I did discover that a few mages didn't fit the 200/356 ratio. However they were only off by a few pixels, so I excepting "pinching" and "pulling" for this use-case.
- But, something to consider down the road.

# Additional Notes & Thoughts...

### Choice to stay with native javaScript
I'd read on the directions that React + Typescript is used on internal projects. However, my depth of knowledge with typescript is limited, so I opted to keep it as close to native javaScript so it'd be ready to update to React or any other framework.
